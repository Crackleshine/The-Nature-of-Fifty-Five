		<h2>Interview Log 343-█: The ██████ Enquiry</h2>
	<div class="box-1">
		<h3><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-343 </h3>
		<h3><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr Kant</h3>
		<h3><strong>Foreword:</strong> Interview with SCP-343 to ascertain the nature of SCP-055. Based on an analysis of timestamps in the recordings of Researcher [REDACTED] interview with SCP-343. There has been noted to be a discrepancy in the time taken to ‘describe’ what SCP-055 is. This interview aims to clarify SCP-343’s description of SCP-055.</h3>

			<br>
			<p><strong>Dr Kant:</strong> I would like to make it clear that I’ll prefer to stick to conversing within the constraints of language.</p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong> Of course my son. Has it ever struck you as <i>odd</i> that your division has both a [REDACTED] and Kant? And yet you insist on using science as a means to arrive at knowledge. I'll have you know I don't deal in coincidences. </p>
			<p><strong>Dr Kant:</strong>  We are exploring all possibilities at the moment SCP-343.</p>
			<h4>*SCP-343 darkens*</h4>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong> Men have died for making light of <i>my</i> signs, Kant.</p>
			<p><strong>Dr Kant:</strong>  We mean no disrespect SCP-343.</p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong> Call me Father, but of all the progress you have made I would think that that nature of SCP-055 is best discussed with Descartes, the Greeks and even your predecessor, <i><strong>Kant</strong></i>.</p>
			<p><strong>Dr Kant:</strong> SCP-343, we have observed that in [REDACTED] interview, each time [REDACTED] enquired about the nature of SCP-055 the gap in which its nature is communicated verbally differs could you explain why?</p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  That is…intriguing. Clearly the █████ you know as SCP-055 is a ██████████.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>*Kant is informed through his communicator that the time taken to describe SCP-055 differs from previously observed attempts.*</h4>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Dr Kant:</strong>  Father can you repeat what you just said?</p>
			<br>
			<h4>*SCP-343 is observed to be distracted*</h4>
			<br>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  I mean it is a ███</p>
			<p><strong>Dr Kant:</strong>  Father…</p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  It is a ████████████████████</p>
			<br>
			<h4>*SCP-343 is observed to be, uncharacteristically, visibly distressed, he tries to name SCP-055 multiple time, its description changes on each naming*</h4>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Dr Kant:</strong>  Father! Please have mercy!</p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  YOU WANTED THIS BOY, YOU WANTED TO KNOW IT IS– ███████████████████████████████████████████████</p>
