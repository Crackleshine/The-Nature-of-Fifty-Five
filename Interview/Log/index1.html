		<h2>Interview Log 343-1: The First Enquiry</h2>
	<div class="box-1">
		<h3><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-343 </h3>
		<h3><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Researcher Hume</h3>
		<h3><strong>Foreword:</strong>Interview with SCP-343 to ascertain the nature of SCP-055.</h3> 
			<br>
			<strong><h3>[BEGIN LOG]</h3></strong>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Hume:</strong> Nice to see you again Father.</p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong> Hume! Glad to see you’ve made time to visit, how is you daughter fairing?</p>
			<p><strong>Hume:</strong>  My daughter is doing well. She’s in her final year of high school and eager to move – apparently away from me.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>*SCP-343 laughs heartily and materializes two goblets of wine, offering one to Researcher Hume, who refuses*</h4>
			<br>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  Fret not my son, they all grow so fast. It reminds me of the first, what-you-call-it… Saturdays. Look at you know! Looking to ask of the unknowable.</p>
			<p><strong>Hume:</strong>  I presume you know my reason for being here?</p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  Ask and it shall be given.</p>
			<p><strong>Hume:</strong>  It’s about SCP-055. Its proprieties defy the discernment its nature. If you may Father, could you enlighten us as you once did?</p>
			<br>
			<h4>*SCP-343 darkens*</h4>
			<br>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  The tree was a mistake, but a necessary one Hume. I ask of you; do you really need to know? Knowledge begets consequences.</p>
			<p><strong>Hume:</strong>  I – I, yes father I’m under orders.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>*Hume panics and address the camera*</h4>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Hume:</strong>  I did not mean to say that.</p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  Of course, you didn’t, but I can make them go away Hume.</p>
			<p><strong>Hume:</strong>  No…no I need to know, myself I mean. It is a tremendous security breach, especially after that dammed letter… I need to know, the division needs to know, humanity – needs to know.</p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  That letter, I have to admit that that was a good one form those artists. But I see you have made up your mind.</p>
			<p><strong>Hume:</strong>  Yes…Yes, I have.</p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  SCP–055 is a ████████</p>
			<p><strong>Hume:</strong>  Sorry a…</p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  A ███ </p>
			<p><strong>Hume:</strong>  I don’t… understand Father.</p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  I didn’t think you would, it does not exist in your language Hume. All your ‘ideas’ and ‘impressions’ cannot account for what it is, the closest thing you can describe as being something noumenal.</p>
			<p><strong>Hume:</strong>  That’s...</p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  Ah yes, the original Hume and Kant, really fond of those men. Fitting how their epistemology relates so closely with your division’s research, yet you choose to ignore them. Hume, sometimes science isn’t always the answer. Have you tried taking off those transcendental glasses?</p>
			<br>
			<h4>*Hume is visibly puzzled but deep in thought*.</h4>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Hume:</strong>  I’ll be sure to relay the message. Say…if language is a limatation, the words to describe SCP-055 has no relational meaning… how can we know it is an Antimeme, that it’s <i>not</i> a sphere?</p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  I will have to show you Hume.</p>
			<p><strong>Hume:</strong>  Show? </p>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  Yes, take a seat.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>*Hume takes a seat opposite SCP-343*</h4>
			<br>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong> Are you sure about this Hume?</p>
			<p>Hume: Yes.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>*SCP-343 is observed to hold eye contact with Hume for approximately three minutes. At the second minute mark, Hume is observed to undergo a dissociative seizure.*</h4>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Hume:</strong>  Sub–sub…sss…subl…<i><strong>SUBLIME.</Strong></i></p>
			<br>
			<h4>*Security is dispatched to restrain and transport Hume for medical attention. They are observed entering the interview room and rather than carrying out their assigned tasks, knelt and begin begging SCP-343 for mercy. Hume stops moving*</h4>
			<br>
			<p><strong>SCP-343:</strong>  That’s enough for today.</p>
